# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python is
#   defined in the environment. But for an app, they can be useful.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if you'd like to ignore it, uncomment the following line:
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
